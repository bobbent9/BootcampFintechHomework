# Case Study - Orion Advisor Solutions

## Overview and Origin

* Name of the company?
Orion Advisor Solutions

* When was the company incorporated?
1999

* Who are the founders of the company?
Eric Clarke

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Orion Advisor Services was founded as a sister company of CLS Investments. CLS was unable to find a software solution for portfolio management that satisfied their desire for growth. Rather than settling, Orion was founded and marketed to other firms that were looking for a better solution. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Original development was funded by sister company, CLS Investments. The company is now fully profitable.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Orion Advisor Solutions started out by providing software solutions to RIA and similar firms. Specifically, Orion started as a Portfolio Management System. Now, through growth, their primary software solution tackles many of the software needs of RIA firms, broker dealers, etc. From trading and rebalancing, to client portal, to billing and more. 
Additionally, through acquisitions, Orion Advisor Solutions also offers a TAMP (Turnkey Asset Management Platform), Planning software (Advizr) and investment management through the original company (CLS Investments), which is now a subsidiary of Orion.   

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Data management/SQL, APIs and integrations, algorithmic trading with their Eclipse platform 

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Orion Advisor Solutions primarily works in the Wealth Management industry, however some of the subsidiaries (CLS Investments) are somewhat more geared towards Investment Management in some ways. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
The largest trend in the Wealth Management Industry has been fee compression and robo-advisors. The fee-based system is becoming ultra competitive and fees are at all time lows. This leads to innovation in the back office and the technology side of the business, since time is essentially money to these firms. No longer can firms get away with handling large manual workloads without staying competitive with their fees. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Albridge, Morningstar, Envestnet, Advent, Broadridge, AssetBook

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
In the early 2010s, many software solutions in the RIA space began to "specialize" in that they did only one or very few things, but did them well. Orion is pushing a change in that landscape by continuing to add more and more tools within their platform that eliminate the need for advisors to go out and add more and more softwares that do not integrate well to their tech stack. 
As this transition continues, I expect to see other firms like Morningstar and Advent/Black Diamond make acquisitions to keep up and attempt to keep pace in competition. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
As of the 2020 T3 Conference Survey, sampling over 5500 firms, Orion was third in market share for Portfolio Management Systems at 12.37%, up from 9.40% in 2019. The survey also tracks platforms that firms are considering. Orion had nearly twice the considerations as the next closest competitor at 291(out of 1,111).

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Orion boasted the second highest satisfaction rating at 7.84 (out of 10) in the 2020 T3 Survey referenced above. Orion was the only solution in the top five(by market share) portfolio management category whose market share increased from 2019 to 2020. This trend shows a continuing migration towards their all-in-one solution. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
One of the primary functions required of an RIA firm that isn't yet provided by Orion Advisor Solutions is that of a CRM (Customer Relationship Management). Orion offers trading, billing, portfolio management and much much more, however the CRM is the lifeblood of many RIAs and similar firms. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Adding this capability will greatly increase their appeal to firms looking for all-in-one solutions. Orion is uniquely positioned to add this feature due to their varying integrations with existing CRM platforms. Their experiences on the positives and negatives of the space should lend to a polished product. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
No new technologies would be required to develop this new tool for Orion Advisor Solutions. The company can build on their current experience and existing infrastructure to accomplish this addition.
